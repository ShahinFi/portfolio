          I'm Shine, PhD, a
          <strong>former postdoctoral researcher</strong> in nano-photonics who
          defied the conventions, underwent a <strong>metamorphosis</strong>,
          and transformed into a <strong>software engineer</strong>. As a
          scientist, I found myself bound by the laws of physics, limiting the
          vast expanse of my imagination. Yearning for a canvas where
          imagination knew no bounds, I made the audacious decision to pivot to
          software engineering, to
          <strong>create unbounded by the constraints of physical laws</strong>.
          This decision wasn't just a career shift; it was a rebellion against
          the limitations that science imposed. I aspired to transcend the laws
          of physics, to become the
          <strong>deity of my own digital realm</strong>.

          Join me on this extraordinary journey, where breaking the laws of
          physics is not just a rebellion but a path to becoming the divine
          architect of a universe uniquely our own.
